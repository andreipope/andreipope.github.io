My name is Andrei, and I'm an experienced technical writer. I worked for over ten years for one of the Fortune 500 companies: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. I love to write in an accessible style, to break down difficult subjects and make them fresh, relevant, and engaging.

I like to not only get things done but get things done in the proper way.

Below are a few samples of my writing.
