* “Andrei is a very knowledgeable tech content writer. His texts are well-structured, easy-to-read and clearly indicate his in-depth understanding of the subject. His English skills are perfect. I would love to note, that Andrei is a wonderful communicator, he is always online, updating on the progress. The way he understands tasks and delivers exactly what is needed is spectacular. We had an emergency situation and needed a huge piece of content (devops/cloud corporate brochure). Andrei had completed everything in just one day! He really saved the day, so I would love to express our gratitude one more time, what a great job! Quality is of course top-notch, strongly recommend and will definitely hire again.”
